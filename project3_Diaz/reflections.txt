• What were the most important changes you made to the form, and why?
	• The form had many areas of improvement but these were the most important:
		○ One thing I did was replace the DELETE method with method POST. This would allow the browser to actually submit payload using a support method. 
		○ To prevent from being pushed off screen because of the CSS I made the password field visible with a real type password. This helps with usability and makes the UI less deceptive. 
		○ Also, added required critical fields with constraints that helps block bad input before it can affect the server. In addition to that I had to add the 10 word limit, JavaScript helper, and a non-script notice that acknowledges the server has to enforce rules. 

• How did you decide what validation rules to apply?
	• To decide on what validation rules to apply I narrowed it down to five areas; username, password, age, email, and message limit. 
	• When it comes to the password and username I used the obvious whitelist requirements. This would be a mix of upper, lower, digit, symbols, and specific lengths. 
	• In the profile section with age and email; age is set to numeric only and has realistic bounds to avoid decimals. 
	• For the final validation I used the message that states it’s a 10 word limit and it will display the remaining count along with a block if they try to go over the limit. 

• What is one security issue you addressed, and how did your change help prevent it?
	• The security issue I address in this project was the hidden password field. I think off screen inputs can be risky and misleading. So I figured it was better to have a visible proper password input. Also, I used textContent only to help prevent DOM based XSS. 

• (Optional) What would you do differently if this were a live production form?
	• I would use hash passwords with more modern algorithms, add CSRF tokens, and possible a server side that does validation and logging. I also think adding a strong context security policy with automated test for validation would be good to have.
